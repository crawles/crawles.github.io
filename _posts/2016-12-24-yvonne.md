Rest in peace dearest Yvonne Lee.

over the past 2 years she and i often spoken about how harsh and unfair the world is. 

we openly discussed suicide and depression.

she shared her concerns around hard core challenges at work, displacement with family and friends, and partnership yearnings.

the last time we chatted was when i decided to move to the US back in SEP to work on the hillary campaign. she was supportive and excited for me.

we would meet for coffee to talk about the impossibilities of life. she spoke with a sense of urgency. 

"do what you think is right,be vulnerable and whole hearted, have courage and pursue your dreams."

she was so proud of what she had achieved.

she had the rare ability of cutting through the bullshit.

we shared a lot. 

she helped me come to terms with many things and so i am eternally grateful.

i'm now waking up to find out she's gone and it's devastating.

is there some way I can find out more about what happened to her? 

in shock...

in the name of yvonne, her beautiful energy, hope, pride, power, dreams, independence and freedom...

how lucky we all were to have had such a friend.

i will miss you.
