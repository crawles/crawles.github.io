Guysssss!!!!! I don't know what to say...

I'll write a much more useful thank you blog soon. My next step is to join the engineering team at Pivotal NYC.

For now. Let me just say hugs and thank you to everyone at Readify who I have had the pleasure of working with. I've seen first hand how and why Readify hires incredible talent. It has been a privilege for me to have been part of such a team.

I won't list names. Everyone I have worked with at Readify has saved my soul in many different ways. Thank you on many levels. Personal. Professional. Family. Friendship. Body. Mind. Spirit.

Working in agile software development you across banking, medical, and government projects has taken me down a rabbit hole of new possibilities. I did not expect to learn the things I learnt at Readify.

Most likely Readify will go down as the most eye opening job I will ever have. It turned me into a real life technology professional.

Readify is unrelenting, supportive, inspiring and empowering.

I firmly believe Readify is the number one tech consultancy in Australia. #BestPlaceToWork #GoingPlaces

Let's stay in touch and continue to build awesome stuff.
