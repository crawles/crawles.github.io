Moving to NYC. Sold my car with HelloCars.

I recommend it. HelloCars is changing the way people buy and sell cars.

Here's how it works:

1. Go to [http://www.hellocars.com.au](hellocars.com.au).
2. Enter your cars details. They will give you a quote range immediately.
3. They'll call you to organise an inspection and once that's done they'll email you an exact quote for the car.

The quote they gave me was pretty much exactly $1000 up from three nearby car dealerships.

_"HelloCars base their pricing on a number of factors including; exact model and features, how many kilometres it has travelled, market demand at the time of sale and market price estimations from Redbook and a variety of other sources."_

The process is so simple it's something you can do from overseas.

From my understanding, HelloCars primarily works as an onseller. They buy the car and sell it within 2 weeks to someone else. They basically do all the leg work of trying to sell it online. They have no need for a shop front or staff waiting around so they cut above the competition.

If they don't find a buyer the quote still stands. They pick up the car and pay up either way. They guarantee sale within 30 days.

In 2014 I bought my Mazda 2 for AU$16k. Today I sold it for AU$12k to HelloCars. Awesome job guys!
