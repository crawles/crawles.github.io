What is behind Trump's Rhetoric?

I call it Trump Ammunition. #TrumpAmmo

Here's how it works.

When trump is confronted with a problem he doesn't consider policy or purpose. Instead he creates ammunition for his supporters.

Trump Ammunition is a series of simple one liners that are easy to remember. Statements that supporters can use when they are confronted.

We humans do not need reason to believe. We need sentences that we can cling to, and repeat, when life deals us a cruel blow.

In this way Trump is able to spread without binding to the truth, actively solving problems or convincing people of a better way.

Imagine how powerful #TrumpAmmo could be when used in your own working life.
