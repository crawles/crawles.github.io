In this post, I show an approach to deploying a scalable trained sentiment classifier that can also conveniently be used for additional text analytics and other data science tasks.

Specifically, in this post I demonstrate how to:

* Serve a classifier as a microservice accessible via a RESTful API
* Deploy a Jupyter Notebook (via [Jupyter Kernel Gateway](https://github.com/jupyter/kernel_gateway)) as a microservice to Pivotal Cloud Foundry
