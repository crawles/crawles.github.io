Analytics have become a major tool in the sports world, and in the NBA in particular analytics have shaped how the sport is played. The league has skewed towards taking more 3-point shots due to their high efficiency as measured by points per field goal attempt. In this post I evaluate and analyze this trend in the NBA using season statistics data going back to 1979 along with geospatial shot chart data. The concepts in this post -- data cleansing, visualization, and modeling in Spark -- are general data science concepts and are applicable for other tasks beyond analyzing sports data. The post concludes with my general impressions about using Spark and with tips and suggestions for new users.
