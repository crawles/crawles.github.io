We created a workflow to:

1. Create features and labels on a subsample of data using Pandas and train an initial model locally
2. Create features and labels on the full dataset using BigQuery
3. Utilize BigQuery ML to build a scalable machine learning model
4. (Advanced) Build a forecasting model using Recurrent Neural Networks in Keras and TensorFlow
