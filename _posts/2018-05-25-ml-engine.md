Training ML models in the cloud makes a lot of sense. Why? Among many reasons, it allows you to train on large amounts of data with plentiful compute and perhaps train many models in parallel. Plus itâ€™s not hard to do! On Google Cloud Platform, you can use Cloud ML Engine to train machine learning models in TensorFlow and other Python ML libraries (such as scikit-learn) without having to manage any infrastructure. In order to do this, you will need to put your code into a Python package (i.e. add setup.py and __init__.py files). In addition, it is a best practice to organize your code into a model.py and task.py. In this blog post, I will step you through what this involves.
