I"k<p>In this post, I show an approach to deploying a scalable trained sentiment classifier that can also conveniently be used for additional text analytics and other data science tasks.</p>

<p>Specifically, in this post I demonstrate how to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Serve a classifier as a microservice accessible via a RESTful API</li>
  <li>Deploy a Jupyter Notebook (via <a href="https://github.com/jupyter/kernel_gateway">Jupyter Kernel Gateway</a>) as a microservice to Pivotal Cloud Foundry</li>
</ul>
