I"F<p>We created a workflow to:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Create features and labels on a subsample of data using Pandas and train an initial model locally</li>
  <li>Create features and labels on the full dataset using BigQuery</li>
  <li>Utilize BigQuery ML to build a scalable machine learning model</li>
  <li>(Advanced) Build a forecasting model using Recurrent Neural Networks in Keras and TensorFlow</li>
</ol>
