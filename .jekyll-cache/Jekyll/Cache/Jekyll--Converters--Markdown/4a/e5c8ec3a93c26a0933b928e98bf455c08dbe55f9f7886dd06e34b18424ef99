I"<p>Data scientists love Jupyter Notebook, Python, and Pandas. And they also write SQL. I created sql_magic to facilitate writing SQL code from Jupyter Notebook to use with both Apache Spark (or Hive) and relational databases such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, Pivotal Greenplum and HDB, and others. The library supports <a href="https://www.sqlalchemy.org/">SQLAlchemy</a> connection objects, <a href="http://initd.org/psycopg/">psycopg</a> connection objects, <a href="https://docs.databricks.com/spark/latest/gentle-introduction/sparksession.html">SparkSession and SQLContext</a> objects, and other connections types. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">%%read_sql</code> magic function returns results as a Pandas DataFrame for analysis and visualization.</p>
